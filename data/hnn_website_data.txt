Description: What is HNN?HNN simulates primary current dipoles, i.e. the neural sources of the sensor-level EEG/MEG signal. The core of HNN is a preconstructed large-scale biophysically detailed template model of a neocortical column model that can be synaptically activated with exogenous layer-specific thalamocortical and cortical-cortical input.HNNs template modelis based on generalizable principles of neocortical circuitry and contains pyramidal and inhibitory across the cortical layers (see Figs 1 & 2, below). HNN simulates the primary electrical current source representing a current dipole in source localized EEG/MEG signals based on theirbiophysical originfrom the intracellular current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites, along with the multiscale corresponding cell and circuit level activity. As such, HNN provides a bidirectional hypothesis testing and development tool aimed to bridge localized macroscale human EEG/MEG signals to the underlying micro/meso scale activity, which can be interrogated in animal models (Fig 1). Importantly, HNN is designed to study the cell and circuit-level origin of waveforms from a single localized region of the cortex. It does not provide tools for the source localization estimation process (i.e. inverse modeling). There are many excellent source localization software for this estimation process. For an example of how to perform source localization usingMNE-pythonfollowed by cell and circuit level interpretation with HNN, see ourexample in HNN-Core.Figure 1HNN’s template model has been used to study the origin of some of the most measured EEG/MEG signals including event-related potentials, low-frequency rhythms, and changes in these signals with behavior, neuropathology, and non-invasive brain stimulation (seepublications). To facilitate the use of this complex neural model by a wide user base, HNN’s template model is embedded in a graphical user interface (HNN-GUI) and developed workflows and tutorials to teach users how to interact with the model and visualize the multi-scale signals underpinnings of source localized MEG/EEG signals. Due to the level of biophysical detail in HNN’s model, the current dipole signal generated in HNN can be directly and statistically compared to the source localized MEG/EEG signal. Out of the box, users can quickly and easily begin to develop and test hypotheses on the origin of their data. Through an interactive GUI investigation users can visualize the impact of changes in model parameters on current dipole signals along with the underlying changes in multilayer cell and circuit dynamics.  Once a good fit to the recorded M/EEG data is found, the model provides detailed and targeted predictions on underlying cell and circuit activity that can be tested with invasive recordings or other imaging modalities (see for example Khan et al 2015, Sherman et al 2016, Bonaiuto et al 2021).OurHNN-GUI tutorialsare designed to teach users how to begin to study the origin of ERP and brain rhythms based on our prior published studies. We provide data and initial parameter sets along with workflows to teach users how to do what we did to develop and test hypotheses on the neural origin of these signals. Once this workflow is learned, users will be able to use HNN to develop and test their own hypotheses.Our goal is not to promote singular theories on the origin of any particular signal, but rather to provide a tool based on known biophysics and training resources where researchers can develop testable predictions on the neural origin of their data.You can read more on the process of modeling large-scale neural models on ourHNN-GUI tutorial page.HNN-Core: HNN’s Computational Core is Developed in NEURON-Python and Designed with Best Open-Source Software Design Practice for Modularity and ExpansionHNN-Coreis a Python package designed to have all the functionality of the HNN-GUI in a command line interface. HNN-core is developed using best practices in open-source software design to facilitate expansion in its utility and community development. Tutorials of use that mimic the HNN-GUI tutorials are available, see theHNN-Core tutorials pageand further functionality are available, seeexamples pageon Github. In practice, after learning how to use HNN through the GUI, if you know a bit about computational neuroscience and Python coding, we encourage you to use HNN-Core and contribute to its development. Please see ourcontributing guidelinesandissues pageon ourHNN-Core github page. Our hope is that, with a large enough HNN user and developer base, crowdsourced knowledge will lead to new testable discoveries on the biophysical origin of human EEG/MEG signals and treatments for neuropathology.Moving Beyond theHNN Template ModelWe are still in the early days of understanding the contributors to macroscale human EEG/MEG signals. HNN’s template model and workflows of use are designed as a starting point for developing and testing predictions on the detailed neural mechanisms contributing to EEG/MEG signals based on the known biophysics of their generation.  The multi-scale simulation (layer and cell-specific spiking, LFP/CSD, etc..) possible with HNN facilitates testing of model-derived predictions across multiple recordings scales and species. HNN-core is designed in a modular fashion so that it can be easily expanded as new knowledge of the cells and circuits that contribute to these signals is learned. A goal is to be able to use other neocortical models within the HNN workflows. Currently, there are3 cortical "template" modelsavailable to study in HNN-Core. We are in the process of developing a new GUI using HNN-Core functions with all of the original GUI functionality and more. Once the new HNN-core-based GUI is complete and documented, the original HNN-GUI will be deprecated. Additional functionality in HNN-core will include the ability to calculate and visualize LFP/CSD (currently possible in HNN-Core) and intracellular calcium signals, more advanced parameter estimation techniques, andexamples of how to integrate source localization in MNE-Python with circuit-level interpretation in HNN.HNN’s Neocortical Column Template Model & The Biophysical Origin of Source Localize MEG/EEG Primary Currents (i.e. Current Dipoles)Figure 2HNN’sunderlying neural modelsimulates the primary electrical currents in the neocortex that create EEG/MEG signals. The model simulations are based on the biophysical origins of the primary electrical currents (see Figure 2). The primary electrical currents (JP) are assumed to be generated by the post-synaptic, intracellular longitudinal current flow in the long and spatially aligned dendrites of a large population of synchronous neocortical pyramidal neurons1,2. These primary currents create volume currents (JV) that propagate through the brain tissue, cerebral spinal fluid, and skull. It is the volume currents that are pick up by the EEG/MEG sensors. “Inverse solution methods” (i.e., source localization methods) applied to the sensor data estimate the location, timing, and directionality of the primary electrical current dipole sources (Jp) (i.e., equivalent current dipoles1).HNN simulates these primary currents from a canonical model of a layered neocortical column via the net intracellular electrical current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites (see schematic to the right. Further details can be found at ourHNN Template Model page). The units of measure that come out of the model are directly comparable to those estimated from source localization methods, namely, nano-ampere-meters (nAm).The HNN software enables visualization of primary electrical currents (i.e., equivalent current dipoles) (nAm), individual cell spiking activity, and calculation of frequency domain oscillations (time-frequency analysis and power spectral density).HNN is intended for studying circuit activity from a single source localized region of interest based on the local network dynamics, and the thalamo-cortical and cortical-cortical inputs that contribute to the local activity.
HNN is not designed to simulate the activity across the entire cortex.Building from a history ofprior published work, a pre-assembled and pre-tuned neocortical template model that represents a generalizable, canonical cortical column is provided. The template circuit includes a scalable number of neurons and adjustable parameters along with simulation tools to perturb the local network with layer- and cell-specific external drive (i.e., spike driven synaptic input and/or tonic applied currents). See details inHNN Template Model. Tools are also provided for users to directly compare simulated electrical sources with recorded source localized data*.Importantly, HNN was created to be a hypothesis development and testing tool.While the underlying neural model is biophysically principled and based on generalizable features of cortical networks, and also includes neurons with realistic physiology and morphology (see details inHNN Template Model), the model is nonetheless a reduced model of neocortical network dynamics.Any conclusions made are based on the underlying model assumptions, which are outlined in detail in ourHNN Template Modelpage. Users should become familiar with these assumptions at the start of using HNN.We have found the model to be useful for generating novel and testable hypotheses on the circuit origin of some of the most commonly measured signals, including ERPs and low-frequency oscillations3-7, which provide the basis for the tutorials. As discussed above, the modular design in HNN-core facilitates the process of using other more specialized neocortical column models in HNN. We are working toward a framework to use neocortical column models developed in other software, e.g. (http://www.neurosimlab.com/netpyne) into the HNN simulation framework.We are open-source and encourage input and expansion from the community (see Users Forum).*If you only have sensor data, you can still benefit from our software. The primary currents are the foundation of the sensor signal and, as such, will have similar activity profiles.ReferencesHämäläinen, M., Hari, R., Ilmoniemi, R. J., Knuutila, J. & Lounasmaa, O. V.

Title: Model Validation
Link: https://hnn.brown.edu/assumptions-validation/
Description: Model Assumptions and ValidationHNN is designed to be a tool from which multi-scale testable predictions on the cell and circuit mechanisms generating source-localized M/EEG signals can be made. An advantage of interpreting signals in source space is that HNN does not need to account for the mixing of signals from many regions that contribute to sensor signals, rather this is accounted for using source estimation (e.g., MNE-Python). HNN has been successfully used to develop testable predictions on the multi-scale mechanisms underlying source localized event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-frequency brain rhythms in various experimental conditions (Seepublications page).Here, we provide further information about theassumptions built into the HNN Template Model and into the workflows of use in ourtutorialson how to begin to study the mechanisms creating ERPs and low frequency brain rhythms. We highlight some of the literature that supports these assumptions and emphasize that HNN is a tool to develop testable predictions on the origin of these signals, which may be different depending on the experimental conditions. We also describe theprocess for defining and testing hypotheses and for estimating parametersin HNN. Lastly, we describe the process forvalidating that the multi-scale model-derived predictions are true in the brain.Assumptions Built in the HNN Template Model and Tutorial WorkflowsHNN Template Model AssumptionsWhile theHNN Template Modelincludes biophysical details, it still represents a reduced representation of the full complexity of neocortical circuits. If and how much the finer details of neocortical cells and circuits contribute to macro-scale M/EEG, potential differences across brain areas and species are unknown. The goal of HNN is to provide a tool where testable predictions can be developed and built upon starting with well-established general principles on the canonical nature of neocortical circuitry.As further knowledge is gained, HNN can be adapted to include greater detail.It is well-established that the current flow in the large and spatially aligned cortical pyramidal neuron dendrites is the main generator of primary current dipoles1–6. As such, HNN simulates the averaged equivalent current dipole in a region of interest from a neocortical column model via the net intracellular electrical current flow in the pyramidal neuron dendrites multiplied by their length (see red/green arrows inFig. 1)1–6. This calculation produces physical units of current x distance (nano-Ampere-meter, nAm) that are directly comparable to source localized M/EEG units (e.g.Fig. 2bottom left andFig. 3A/Bbelow).Figure 1HNN Template Model (A) Pyramidal (Pyr, Blue), interneurons (IN, orange), and local network synaptic connectivity. (B) Proximal input pathway relaying spiking information from thalamic sources through excitatory synapses on Pyr proximal dendrites (C) Distal input pathway relaying spiking to distal dendrites. (D) Full network model with an adjustable number of neurons: default is 100 Pyr & 33 IN per layer. A multiplicative scaling factor is applied to estimate the number of synchronous Pyr contributing to a recorded signal. Net current dipole is calculated from the Pyr dendritic current flow (red arrow).HNN’s foundational neocortical column model, referred to as theHNN Template Model(Fig. 1), was developed based on canonical principles of neocortical circuitry and contains minimal circuit elements essential to generating primary current dipoles and connecting to layer and cell-specific neocortical activity2, and at a scale tractable to be run on a laptop.  Details of the model can be found on the HNN Template model page. In brief, the model contains multi-compartment pyramidal neurons in the supragranular (L 2/3) and infragranular layers (L 5) and single-compartment inhibitory neurons in each layer. The morphology and physiology of the neurons and connectivity among the cells were based on empirical data and prior published models, as detailed in earlier publications2,7,8.Further, to represent input to the local network from thalamic or other cortical areas (not explicitly modeled), HNN includes methods to define trains of action potentials in predefined temporal patterns (e.g. see example and histograms inFig. 2) that activate layer-specific excitatory synapses. These drives represent “feedforward” (proximal) and “feedback” (distal) drives, and their post-synaptic targets within the cortical layers are based on well-established connectivity rules9–14.ERP and Low Frequency RhythmTutorialWorkflow AssumptionsAll simulation experiments consist of activating the cortical template model with exogenous feedforward or feedback input, or noise, depending on the experimental conditions you are studying.HNN-GUI tutorials(and correspondingHNN-Core tutorials) are designed to teach users how to activate the network with patterns of exogenous spiking input and noise to study ERPs and low-frequency rhythms. Our tutorials are based on our prior published studies where we developed predictions on the cell and circuit mechanisms underlying ERPs and low-frequency rhythms and differences across experimental conditions. These prior studies were motivated by a long history of research, mainly in animals, investigating the neural mechanisms of ERPs and low-frequency rhythms  (see extensive references e.g. ERPs7,15e.g. alpha rhythms8,16–19, e.g. beta rhythms8,17,19,20e.g. gamma rhythms17,21–24). HNN allowed us to test if the cell and network elements thought to be the primary generators of these signals based on animal research (e.g. a sequence of thalamocortical drive to the network) could produce macro-scale current dipole signals that were in agreement with our recorded data. While the literature guided us to a starting point that constrained the investigation, the exact parameters to use to present the data were unknown. By directly comparing the current dipole output of the model to source localized empirical data, we were able to titrate parameters (both through hand tuning and algorithmic parameter estimation)  to produce a close fit to the source waveform (i.e. small root mean squared error (RMSE)). Once a close fit to the current dipole waveform was established the model provided a number of testable predictions on the underlying cell and circuit activity, i.e. exogenous input timing and strength, cell spiking activity, LFP/CSD, etc. An example of this hypothesis testing and parameter tuning process is described further below.We provide a pre-tuned model along with data and parameter sets from our published studies for users to begin with (e.g., seeFig. 2) and teach users the workflow we used to study the multi-scale origin of these signals. The pre-tuned network and exogenous input parameters distributed with HNN have been a successful starting point for many studies (SeePublications).The model and workflows are meant as a starting point for how to use HNN to generate testable predictions and not to propagate singular theories on signal generation.See below for further details on how to test that model-derived predictions are valid in the real brain.Figure 2 HNN GUIwith example workflow to study the origin of an ERP. 1.

Adjust parameters by exploration followed by optimization algorithms minimizing RMSE.Process for Defining and Testing Hypotheses and Parameter EstimationWorking with large-scale neural models is challenging because not all parameters can be estimated at once. While one might want to simply feed in a waveform and have the model spit out all the possible parameter combinations that can create this waveform, at this time, that is not possible in HNN or in any large-scale neural modeling framework. There are simply too many parameters and possible parameter combinations. In practice, pieces of the model (e.g. individual cells and synaptic connections) are developed and parameters are tuned and fixed based on best-known biophysical constraints (e.g. morphology and physiology). Once an acceptable representation of elements of the model is developed, most parameters are fixed and parameter tuning and estimation are performed on a limited targeted set of parametersto test hypotheses on if and how those parameters contribute to specific signals of interest and changes in the signal across experimental conditions/subjects.HNN provides a pre-tuned neocortical column model and tutorials on how to begin to activate the model with exogenous thalamocortical and cortical-cortical drive as described above. In practice, usersstart with hypotheses about how the network is activated during the experimental conditions they are studying (e.g. sequence of feedforward and feedback drive),andtest if and how the parameters representing this activation (e.g. strength of distal input to layer ⅔ pyramidal vs inhibitory cells) can be adjusted to get an accurate representation of the source data.If they can, then the “tuned” model provides multi-scale testable predictions on the underlying cell and network activity creating the signal. If they can’t, alternative hypotheses can be tested. It may be that more than one set of parameter combinations (i.e. “models”) can provide a “good fit” to the data (defined below). As discussed above, currently in large-scale biophysically detailed models, we can not test all possible parameter combinations. In practice, most parameters are fixed based on best-known constraints and only a small number of parameters are estimated based on “testing hypotheses”. When using HNN, users often define a handful of logical hypotheses and identify the parameters that correspond to testing these hypotheses. Hypothesis testing in this context means that through parameter estimation (described further below) users determine if and how any of the targeted parameters is able to provide a better fit to the data.  If more than one set of parameters generates a good fit to the data, by definition the underlying multiscale cell and circuit level activity will be different because they are defined by different parameters (i.e. “models”). These microcircuit differences provide targets for further model selection based on data from invasive animal recordings and/or other imaging methods, discussed further below.Below, we give a concrete example of how hypotheses can be developed and tested in HNN, and compared to alternative hypotheses. First, we describe the parameter estimation process where the“goodness of fit” of the model is assessed by examining the root mean squared error (RMSE) between the simulated and empirical current source signals. An acceptable fit depends on the user-defined criteria on a good fit threshold.HNN does not currently provide tools for accessing the quality of the fit between model and source data beyond RMSE, nor does it provide a method for statistically comparing alternate models. Rather, the user can test multiple predictions and report the one that gives the closest fit (smallest RMSE) to the data. HNN also does not currently have methods to fit model parameters to other types of empirical data e.g. cell spike rate and/or LFP/CSD. Such method developments are ongoing and represent important future directions.Parameter Estimation ProcessOnce a hypothesized pattern of drive to the local circuit representing the conditions of the experiment is determined, the process for adjusting parameters in HNN is as follows. Users first adjust parameters via exploration and “hand tuning”  to get a sense of how parameter changes map onto multi-scale changes in the model. This sense comes from visually examining the multi-scale output in the HNN GUI, including directly comparing the source signals from the model and data. We can not emphasize enough the importance of hand tuning and exploration to understand how the model components contribute to the signal.Once an initial close representation of the signal is found via hand tuning (i.e. small RMSE error between model and data current dipole waveforms), users can define a targeted set of parameters for algorithmic estimation of values that produce the “best fit to data” (determining the goodness of fit is defined above). Currently, HNN only has built-in parameter estimation tools for parameters of the exogenous drive during an evoked response simulation that employ a temporally-weighted loss function optimized using gradient-free solvers (seeOptimization Tutorial). Additional parameter estimation methods are in the development phase.Once a good first-to-one signal is determined, users may wish to next test hypotheses on the cell and circuit mechanisms underlying differences in signals across experimental conditions (e.g., see testing of hypotheses on differences in sensory-driven responses in typically developing children vs children with autism spectrum disorder25; or differences in auditory evoked responses across hemispheres15).The final set of parameters that produce an accurate representation of the data provides predictions on the circuit activity at multiple scales (cell-specific spiking patterns, LFP/CSD.. etc). These predictions all provide targets for testing further in the real brain (seeFig 3and section below).Parameter SensitivityOnce a “good fit” to data is found (defined above), the sensitivity of the fit to variation in model parameters can be made. HNN is not yet distributing tools for parameter sensitivity analysis. For an example of how to use the python package 'Uncertainty'36to apply sensitivity analysis on parameters see the supplementary materials in the HNN methods paper (Neymotin et al eLife 2020). This example uses the method of variance-based sensitivity analysis through Monte Carlo estimation37and provides Sobol sensitivity indices that can be used to explain the relative contribution of individual parameters on model variance. The total Sobol sensitivity index for each parameter serves as a measure that represents that parameter’s contribution to the variance, and also the contributions resulting from interactions with other parameters being varied38. So a parameter with a low total Sobol sensitivity index can be characterized as an insignificant contributor to variance and can be fixed at its default value during model optimization.Example of how HNN can be used to develop and test hypotheses (see alsoalpha/beta tutorial)A primary example of HNN’s utility in developing and testing hypotheses comes from our work studying the neural origin of the transient 15-29Hhz beta oscillations (e.g. beta events) observed in source-localized MEG signals from SI. Here, beta emerges as part of a rhythm that contains non-overlapping transient alpha and beta components and is known as the somatosensory “mu” rhythm8,19). We began with knowledge from prior studies of the circuit mechanisms underlying alpha and beta generation. A long history of research has shown that alpha rhythms can emerge from ~10Hz bursting in the thalamus that activates the cortex through layer-specific thalamocortical projections (see Hughes and Crunelli 200535for review). Prior theories on beta generation, based mostly on slice experiments and modeling, suggested beta originates from fast synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory neurons that act in concert with slow potassium currents (AHP currents) in excitatory neurons to pace the excitatory cells to fire regularly at a beta frequency17,32–34.HNNs Template Modelcontains the circuit elements needed to test if these mechanisms could account for alpha and beta events in our human MEG data.  We began with parameter exploration and simulated 10Hz bursts of activity that activated the model via the thalamocortical projection pattern (i.e. proximal driveFig. 1) and drove spiking in the cortical excitatory cells, which we predicted could in turn create the beta component of the rhythm through the local excitatory and inhibitory connections. Despite extensive parameter tuning efforts, we found that while alpha could be generated this way, we could not accurately simulate beta.  Instead, by parameter exploration we found a completely novel mechanism that closely produced numerous quantified data features (Fig. 3 A/B8);  this analysis was only possible because of the detail in the HNN template model that enabled a one-to-one comparison between model output and data in the same physical nAm units.  This mechanism suggested that there were two distinct generators of 10Hz bursting activity, one that drove the network through the proximal projection pathway and one through the distal projection pathways (possibly representing activity in lemniscal and non-lemniscal thalamic nuclei ). When the bursts arrived asynchronous to the cortex alpha events emerged and when they arrived nearly synchronously beta events emerged8(see alsoalpha/beta tutorial). Of note, while we examined variation in parameters, we did not perform automated parameter fitting or parameter sensitivity analyses in this study. This mechanism for alpha generation was consistent with prior studies (Bollimunta et al 2008) but represented a completely new theory on the generation of beta. Owing to HNN’s biophysical detail, additional testable predictions on the expected layer-specific LFP and CSD could be made. These predictions were detailed in19and supported by laminar recordings in mice and monkeys (Fig. 3C), and later with high-resolution laminar MEG that also suggested a similar beta event mechanism occurs in the primary motor cortex26. Further model analysis with HNN-predicted beta events generated via these mechanisms may causally suppress tactile perception through the recruitment of supragranular inhibition20; this prediction is currently being tested with invasive animal recordings.Figure 3(A) Hypothesized mechanisms of beta event generation in the HNN model accurately reproduced quantified features of (B) MEG-measured beta events. (C) Multi-scale model predictions on the LFP and CSD underlying the macro-scale beta events were validated with laminar recordings in mice and monkeys19.Validating that the multi-scale model-derived predictions are true in the brainDue to the level of detail inHNNs Template Model, once a “good fit” to the macro-scale current source data is found, multi-scale predictions on the underlying micro- and mesoscale activity are available. There are numerous techniques for validating these multi-scale model-derived predictions, including invasive recordings (e.g. Neuropixels, calcium imaging) in animals, and/or other human imaging modalities (e.g. MRI-spectroscopy, laminar resolution MEG26) to name a few. SeeFig. 3and the description above as one example.We are developing tools that can further facilitate this validation process, including expanded parameter estimation techniques that can constrain model output to multiple data types (e.g. spike rates, LFP/CSD).A key technique for validating model hypotheses is recording across the cortical layers (e.g. laminar recordings) as the source of human M/EEG signals necessarily relies on the integration of information across the layers.In practice, the development and validation of model-derived predictions will take collaborative efforts between researchers with different expertise including human imaging researchers and clinicians, neural modeling experts, and neurophysiologist recording invasively in animal models. A goal of our HNN workshops and open-source modeling framework is to bring together researchers with varied backgrounds and expertise who are all interested in bridging the gap between human and animal research.ReferencesIkeda H, Wang Y, Okada YC.

Description: Optional Demographic InformationPlease consider supporting HNN development efforts by voluntarily providing your demographic informationhere. Note that any demographic information we collect is anonymized and aggregated for reporting on the grants that fund the continued development of HNN. All questions are voluntary.About HNN-CoreHNN-core is the result of an effort to clean up and reorganize the underlying code that defines the HNN software to facilitate expansion and community engagement in HNN's use and development.HNN-core 0.1is a streamlined Python package that contains all of the utility of HNN with a command line interface (CLI). A goal of HNN-core is to provide an object-oriented design that allows the computational neuroscience community to understand and contribute to development and use of the HNN software analysis toolkit. The command-line utility allows easy batch processing and integration with other Python based packages such asMNE-Python.  We are in the process of integrating all of the HNN-core code into theGUI version of HNN.Installing HNN-CoreOn Linux and Mac, it is possible to install HNN-core using a single line:$ pip install hnn_corePlease see theHNN-core documentationfor more detailed installation instructions and troubleshootingHNN-Core can also be installed on the Neuroscience Gateway Portal (NSG). The instructions for getting started are a work in progree. Seeherefor the installation instructions for both HNN-Core and HNN-Core GUI on NSG.Examplesof use are provided for simulating commonly measured MEG/EEG signals, including event related potentials and low-frequency brain rhythms, following theGUI-based tutorials.

Title: HNN GUI Tutorials
Link: https://hnn.brown.edu/tutorials/
Description: OverviewThe overall simulation process in HNN is similar to that in any large-scale neural model study.  Working with large-scale neural models is challenging because not all parameters can be estimated at once. In practice, pieces of the model (e.g. individual cells and synaptic connections) are developed and parameters are tuned and fixed based on best-known biophysical constrained (e.g. morphology and physiology). Once an acceptable baseline model is developed, most parameters are fixed and parameter tuning and estimation are performed on a limited targeted set of parameters to test hypotheses on how those parameters contribute to specific signals of interest and changes in the signal across experimental conditions/subjects.The underlying neocortical column model distributed with HNN has been pre-constructed and tuned based on current-day knowledge of generalizable principles of neocortical circuitry and the biophysical origin of M/EEGcurrent sources signals. The template neocortical model was developed and applied in severalprior publications. Simulation experiments in HNN begin by  “activating” the neocortical column model based on the experimental conditions and questions of interest in your study and “tuning” a targeted set of parametersto develop and test hypotheseson cell and network configurations that can provide a close fit to data.In the tutorials provided here, we demonstrate how we “activated” the HNN network and tuned parameters to study the neural underpinnings of several of the most commonly recorded EEG/MEG signals, including event-related potentials (ERPs) and low-frequency rhythms:
